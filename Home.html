						World Environment Day is celebrated annually on 5 June and is the United Nations' principal vehicle for encouraging awareness and action for the protection of the environment. World Environment Day was designated by the UN General Assembly in 1972 on the first day of United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, resultant from negotiations on the integration of human interactions and the environment.
					</p>

					<p style="font-size: 18px;">
						World Environment Day 2021 ‚Äì Pakistan will host World Environment Day 2021 in partnership with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). This year‚Äôs observance of World Environment Day will be on the theme of ‚Äòecosystem restoration‚Äô and focus on resetting our relationship with nature.
					</p>
					
					<p style="font-size: 18px;">
						Then in 1974, the first World Environment Day was held with the theme ‚ÄúOnly One Earth‚Äù.
						Initially, it was started as a flagship campaign for raising awareness on budding environmental issues from marine pollution and global warming, to sustainable consumption and wildlife crime. The aim of this day is to encourage people worldwide to take care of the Earth or become an agent of change. World Environment Day has grown to become a global platform for public outreach, with participation from over 143 countries annually.

					<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: left;" class="text-success mt-4">
						Environmental protection is the practice of protecting the natural environment by individuals, organizations and governments. Its objectives are to conserve natural resources and the existing natural environment and, where possible, to repair damage and reverse trends.
					</p>
					<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: left;" class="text-success mt-4">
						Environmental Protection includes programs that are aimed at reducing risks to the environment from contaminants such as hazardous materials and wastes, fuels, and oils.  These programs address pollution prevention measures and regulatory compliance by providing procedures for safely working with these materials, inspecting the storage vessels and locations, and designating preventative maintenance procedures.  Also included are environmental emergency plans, which provide the appropriate action to be taken in the event of a spill or release.</p>

					<p style="font-size: 30px;">Save Our üåé !</p>
					
					<p style="font-size: 18px;">
						  The resources and gifts that the Earth provides for us are plentiful. Over centuries, the human race has made use of these resources. Every one has utilized the funds and used to it to benefit themselves. However, the rational use the resources have caused damage on the planet. We are putting the Earth in danger because of the activities we do. It‚Äôs high time we start protecting the Earth and try to save it.

					<p style="font-size: 18px;">
							We can make our earth a better place to live by taking simple steps like planting a tree, throwing waste in proper bins, saying no to the plastic bag, etc. Rather than complaining about pollution, such small steps must be taken to make our environment sustainable.
					</p>	

					<p style="font-size: 18px;">
						  Humans depend on the gifts the planet has provided for them. Therefore, when the resources are in danger, humans won‚Äôt be able to survive without them. It is one of the main reasons why we should start trying to save the Earth. If the planet seizes to exist, so will all the life on the Earth. We won‚Äôt survive if the Earth doesn‚Äôt start healing.	
					</p>
						  
					<p style="font-size: 18px;">
						  All the residents of the world, the Governments and the people should come together and start saving the planet. You can‚Äôt depend solely on the government to save the planet. Each person should take a small step because every little step counts in saving the world. We should start putting collective effort in trying this initiative because the planet needs us right now. It‚Äôs high time we start taking care of the Earth because it has given us unlimited gifts that we have utilized for our advantages.
					</p>

					<p style="font-size: 18px;">
							We should start making efforts to try and save the Earth. Saving the Earth is an activity which like a need of the hour. It‚Äôs essential to start thinking about ways to save the planet. Human has always used the Earth to fulfill their wants and gains. These activities are the reason behind the damage to the Earth.
					</p>

					<p style="font-size: 18px;">
							The planet we live on is one of the only worlds with life on it. Therefore, there‚Äôs nowhere we can go if the Earth seizes to exist. We must start trying to save Earth now.If every person tries to make a small effort, it will make an impact on the planet. When a person starts carrying his bottle and avoids using plastic, the person is reducing the use of plastic.
					</p>

					<p style="font-size: 18px;">
						There are so many other ways a person can try to save the planet, like plant more trees. Instead of cutting trees, if every person plants a few trees, deforestation will reduce on a large scale. It will also improve the air, and the overall environment will change. Water is one of the significant gifts of the planet. However, even if a large percentage of water is on the Earth, you can‚Äôt utilize all of it. Everyone depends on a tiny percentage for their daily consumption and use. We should stop wastage of water and try to conserve as much water as possible.
